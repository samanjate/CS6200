Two linked lists (simple link, not double link) heads are given: headA, and headB; it is also given that the two lists intersect, thus after the intersection they have the same elements to the end. Find the first common element, without modifying the lists elements or using additional datastructures.

a) Write a formal pseudocode, using “next” as a method/pointer to advance to the next element in a list.

b) Write the actual code in a programming language (C/C++, Java, Python etc) of your choice and run it on a made-up test pair of two lists. A good idea is to use pointers to represent the list linkage.
