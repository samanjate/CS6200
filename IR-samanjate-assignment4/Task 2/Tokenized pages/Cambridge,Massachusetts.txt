as
an

village
eight

from

most
of
the
inhabitants
were
descendants
of

puritan
colonists
but
there
was
also
a
small
elite
of
anglican
worthies
who
were
not
involved
in
village
life
who
made
their
livings
from

between

and

cambridge
began
to
grow
rapidly
with
the
construction
of
the
west
boston
bridge
in
1792
that
connected
cambridge
directly
to
boston
making
it
no
longer
necessary
to
travel
eight
miles
13
km
through
the
boston
neck
roxbury
and
brookline
to
cross
the
charles
river
a
second
bridge
the
canal
bridge
opened
in
1809
alongside
the
new
middlesex
canal
the
new
bridges
and
roads
made
what
were
formerly
estates
and
marshland
into
prime
industrial
and
residential
districts
in
the
mid-19th
century
cambridge
was
the
center
of
a
literary
revolution
when
it
gave
the
country
a
new
identity
through
poetry
and
literature
cambridge
was
home
to
some

cambridge
main

were
roads
to
connect
various
areas
of
cambridge
to
the
bridges
in
addition
the
town
was
connected
to
the
boston
maine
railroad
leading
to
the
development
of
porter

as
well
as
the
creation
of
neighboring
town
somerville
from
the
formerly
rural
parts
of
charlestown
cambridge
was
incorporated
as
a
city
in
1846
this
was
despite
noticeable
tensions
between
east
cambridge
cambridgeport
and
old
cambridge
that
stemmed
from
differences
in
each
area
culture
sources
of
income
and
the
national
origins
of
the
residents
the

commercial
center
began
to
shift
from
harvard
square
to
central
square
which
became
the
downtown
of
the
city

this
time

1850
and
1900
cambridge
took
on
much
of
its
present
characterstreetcar
suburban
development
along
the

working-class
and
industrial
neighborhoods
focused
on

middle-class
housing

built
on

on
the
minor
hills
of
the
city
the
coming
of
the
railroad
to
north
cambridge
and
northwest
cambridge
then
led
to
three
major
changes
in
the
city
the
development
of
massive
brickyards
and
brickworks
between
massachusetts
ave
concord
ave
and
alewife
brook
the
ice-cutting
industry
launched
by
frederic
tudor
on
fresh
pond
and
the
carving
up
of
the
last
estates
into
residential
subdivisions
to
provide
housing
to
the
thousands
of
immigrants
that
arrived
to
work
in
the
new
industries
for
many
decades
the
city
largest
employer
was
the

with
nearly
120,000

among
the

cambridge
lost
much
of
its
industrial
base
it
also
began
the
transition
to
being
an
intellectual
rather
than
an
industrial
center
harvard
university
had
always
been
important
in
the
city
both
as
a
landowner
and
as
an
institution
but
it
began
to
play
a
more
dominant
role
in
the
city
life
and
culture
when
radcliffe
college
was
established
in
1879
the
town
became
a
mecca
for
some
of
the
nation
most
academically
talented
female
students
also
the
move
of
the
massachusetts
institute
of
technology
from
boston
in
1916
ensured
cambridge
status
as
an
intellectual
center
of
the
united
states
after
the
1950s
the
city
population
began
to
decline
slowly
as
families
tended
to
be
replaced
by
single
people
and
young
couples
the
1980s
brought
a
wave
of
high-technology
startups
creating
software
such
as
visicalc
and
lotus
1-2-3
and
advanced
computers
but
many
of
these
companies
fell
into
decline
with
the
fall
of
the
minicomputer
and
dos-based
systems
the
city
continues
to
be
home
to
many
startups
kendall
square
continued
to
be
a
major
software
hub
through
the
dot-com
boom
and
today
hosts
offices
of
major
technology
companies
including
google
microsoft

harvard
plans
to
start
experiments
with
recombinant
dna
led
to
a
three-month
moratorium
and
a
citizen
review
panel
in
the
end
cambridge
decided
to
allow
such
experiments
but
passed
safety
regulations
in
1977
this
led
to
regulatory
certainty
and
acceptance
when
biogen
opened
a
lab
in
1982
in
contrast
to
hostility
which
caused
the
genetic
institute
a
harvard
spinoff
to
abandon
somerville
and
boston
for
cambridge
the
biotech

industries
have
since
thrived

cambridge
had
one
of
the
most
expensive
housing
markets
in
the
northeastern
united
statescitation

while
maintaining
much
diversity
in

age
it
became
harder
and
harder
for
those
who
grew
up
in
the
city
to
be
able
to
afford
to
stay
the
end
of
rent
control
in
1994
prompted
many
cambridge
renters
to
move
to
housing
that
was
more
affordable

somerville
and
other
communities
as
