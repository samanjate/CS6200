sustainability
sustainability
science
has
emerged
in
the
21st
century
as
a
new
academic
discipline
this
new
field
of
science
was
officially
introduced
with
a
birth
statement
at
the
world
congress
challenges
of
a
changing
earth
2001
in
amsterdam
organized
by
the
international
council
for
science
icsu
the
international
geosphere-biosphere
programme
igbp
the
international
human
dimensions
programme
on
global
environmental
change
and
the
world
climate
research
programme
wcrp
the
field
reflects
a
desire
to
give
the
generalities
and
broad-based
approach
of
sustainability
a
stronger
analytic
and
scientific
underpinning
as
it
brings
together
scholarship
and
practice
global
and
local
perspectives
from
north
and
south
and
disciplines
across
the
natural
and
social
sciences
engineering
and
medicine
it
can
be
usefully
thought
of
as
neither
basic
nor
applied
research
but
as
a
field
defined
by
the
problems
it
addresses
rather
than
by
the
disciplines
it
employs
it
serves
the
need
for
advancing
both
knowledge
and
action
by
creating
a
dynamic
bridge
between
the
two
the
field
is
focused
on
examining
the
interactions
between
human
environmental
and
engineered
systems
to
understand
and
contribute
to
solutions
for
complex
challenges
that
threaten
the
future
of
humanity
and
the
integrity
of
the
life
support
systems
of
the
planet
such
as
climate
change
biodiversity
loss
pollution
and
land
and
water
degradation
sustainability
science
like
sustainability
itself
derives
some
impetus
from
the
concepts
of
sustainable
development
and
environmental
science
sustainability
science
provides
a
critical
framework
for
sustainability
while
sustainability
measurement
provides
the
evidence-based
quantitative
data
needed
to
guide
sustainability
governance
consensual
definition
of
sustainability
science
is
as
elusive
as
the
definition
of
sustainability
or
sustainable
development
as
outlined
by
the
sustainability
science
program
at
harvard
university
center
for
international
development
sustainability
science
seeks
to
advance
basic
understanding
of
the
dynamics
of
human-environment
systems
to
facilitate
the
design
implementation
and
evaluation
of
practical
interventions
that
promote
sustainability
in
particular
places
and
contexts
and
to
improve
linkages
between
relevant
research
and
innovation
communities
on
the
one
hand
and
relevant
policy
and
management
communities
on
the
other
a
more
broad-based
definition
is
the
cultivation
integration
and
application
of
knowledge
about
earth
systems
gained
especially
from
the
holistic
and
historical
sciences
such
as
geology
ecology
climatology
oceanography
coordinated
with
knowledge
about
human
interrelationships
gained
from
the
social
sciences
and
humanities
in
order
to
evaluate
mitigate
and
minimize
the
consequences
regionally
and
worldwide
of
human
impacts
on
planetary
systems
and
on
societies
across
the
globe
and
into
the
future
that
is
in
order
that
humans
can
be
knowledgeable
earth
stewards
it
has
been
noted
that
the
new
paradigm
must
encompass
different
magnitudes
of
scales
of
time
space
and
function
multiple
balances
dynamics
multiple
actors
interests
and
multiple
failures
systemic
faults
others
take
a
much
broader
view
of
sustainability
science
emphasizing
the
need
to
analyze
the
root
causes
of
the
fundamental
unsustainability
of
the
prevailing
economic
system
such
as
the
emphasis
on
growth
as
key
to
solving
political
and
social
problems
and
advancying
society
well-being
in
a
2012
article
entitled
sustainability
science
needs
to
include
sustainable
consumption
published
in
environment
science
and
policy
for
sustainable
development
halina
brown
argues
that
sustainability
science
must
include
the
study
of
the
sociology
of
material
consumption
and
the
structure
of
consumerist
society
the
role
of
technology
in
aggravating
the
unsustainable
social
practices
as
well
as
in
solving
the
problems
they
create
the
macroeconomic
theories
that
presuppose
economic
growth
as
a
necessary
condition
for
advancing
societal
well-being
and
others
the
case
for
making
research
and
development
an
important
component
of
sustainable
development
strategies
was
embraced
by
many
international
scientific
organizations
in
the
mid-1980s
promoted
by
the
brundtland
commission
report
our
common
future
in
1987
and
noted
in
the
agenda
21
plan
that
emerged
from
the
united
nations
conference
on
environment
and
development
in
1992
and
further
developed
at
the
world
summit
on
sustainable
development
held
in
johannesburg
in
2002
the
topics
of
the
following
sub-headings
indicate
recurring
themes
that
are
addressed
in
the
literature
of
sustainability
science
only
in
2010
have
the
seminal
papers
and
thinking
of
sustainability
scientists
been
drawn
together
in
2010
a
compendium
of
basic
papers
in
this
new
discipline
was
published
by
robert
kates
with
introduction
by
william
clark
as
readings
in
sustainability
science
and
technology
an
introduction
to
the
key
literature
of
sustainability
science
the
2012
commentary
by
halina
brown
extensively
expands
the
scope
of
that
seminal
publication
this
is
work
in
progress
the
2012
encyclopedia
of
sustainability
science
and
technology
was
created
as
a
collaboration
of
over
1000
scientists
to
provide
peer-reviewed
entries
covering
sustainability
research
and
policy
evaluations
of
technology
knowledge
structuring
has
been
identified
as
an
essential
first
step
in
the
effort
to
acquire
a
comprehensive
view
of
sustainability
issues
which
are
both
complex
and
interconnected
this
is
needed
as
a
response
to
the
requirements
of
academia
industry
and
government
the
key
research
and
data
for
sustainability
are
sourced
from
many
scientific
disciplines
topics
and
organisations
a
major
part
of
knowledge
structuring
will
entail
building
up
the
tools
that
provide
an
overview
of
what
is
known
sustainability
science
can
construct
and
coordinate
a
framework
within
which
the
vast
amount
of
data
can
be
easily
accessed
the
attempt
by
sustainability
science
to
understand
the
integrated
whole
of
planetary
and
human
systems
requires
cooperation
between
scientific
social
and
economic
disciplines
public
and
private
sectors
academia
and
government
in
short
it
requires
a
massive
global
cooperative
effort
and
one
major
task
of
sustainability
science
is
to
assist
integrated
cross-disciplinary
coordination
in
recent
years
there
have
been
set
up
more
and
more
study
courses
that
are
directly
addressing
the
issues
of
sustainability
science
and
global
change
in
2010
a
compendium
of
basic
papers
in
this
new
discipline
was
published
by
robert
kates
as
