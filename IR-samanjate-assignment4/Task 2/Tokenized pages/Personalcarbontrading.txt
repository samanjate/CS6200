personal
personal
carbon
trading
is
the
generic
term
for
a
number
of
proposed
emissions
trading
schemes
under
which
emissions
credits
would
be
allocated
to
adult
individuals
on
a
broadly
equal
per
capita
basis
within
national
carbon
budgets
individuals
then
surrender
these
credits
when
buying
fuel
or
electricity
individuals
wanting
or
needing
to
emit
at
a
level
above
that
permitted
by
their
initial
allocation
would
be
able
to
purchase
additional
credits
from
those
using
less
creating
a
profit
for
those
individuals
who
emit
at
a
level
below
that
permitted
by
their
initial
allocation
current
proposals
include
individuals
would
most
likely
hold
their
emissions
credits
in
electronic
accounts
and
would
surrender
them
when
they
make
carbon-related
purchases
such
as
electricity
heating
fuel
and
petroleum
pcas
could
also
require
individuals
to
use
credits
for
public
transport
tradable
energy
quotas
would
bring
all
other
sectors
of
society
eg
industry
government
within
the
scope
of
a
single
scheme
individuals
who
exceed
their
allocation
ie
those
who
want
to
use
more
emissions
credits
than
they
have
been
given
would
be
able
to
purchase
additional
credits
from
those
who
use
less
so
individuals
that
are
under
allocation
would
profit
from
their
small
carbon
footprint
there
are
two
types
of
carbon
credits
certified
emission
reduction
credits
euas
and
cers
and
verified
carbon
credits
proponents
of
personal
carbon
trading
claim
that
it
is
an
equitable
way
of
addressing
climate
change
and
peak
oil
as
it
could
guarantee
that
a
national
economy
lives
within
its
agreed
carbon
budget
and
ensure
fair
access
to
fuel
and
energy
they
also
believe
it
would
increase
carbon
literacy
among
the
public
while
encouraging
more
localised
economies
personal
carbon
trading
has
been
criticised
for
its
possible
complexity
and
high
implementation
costs
as
yet
there
is
minimal
reliable
data
on
these
issues
there
is
also
the
fear
that
personal
rationing
and
trading
of
allowances
will
be
politically
unacceptable
especially
if
those
allowances
are
used
to
buy
from
industries
who
are
already
passing
on
costs
from
their
participation
in
carbon
levy
or
trading
schemes
such
as
the
eu
etscitation
needed
research
in
this
area
has
shown
that
personal
carbon
trading
would
be
a
progressive
policy
instrument
redistributing
money
from
the
rich
to
the
poor
as
the
rich
use
more
energy
than
the
poor
and
so
would
need
to
buy
allowances
from
them
this
is
in
contrast
to
a
direct
carbon
tax
under
which
all
lower
income
people
are
worse
off
prior
to
revenue
redistribution
norfolk
island
is
trialling
the
world
first
personal
carbon
trading
programme
starting
in
2011
the
climate

act

powers

the
uk
government
to
introduce
a
personal
carbon

scheme
without

in

2008
defra
completed
a
pre-feasibility
study
into
teqs
with
the
headline
finding
that
personal
carbon
trading
has
potential
to
engage
individuals
in
taking
action
to
combat
climate
change
but
is
essentially
ahead
of
its
time
and
expected
costs
for
implementation
are
high
based
on
this
defra
announced
that
the
uk
government
remains
interested
in
the
concept
of
personal
carbon
trading
and
although
it
will
not
be
continuing
its
research
programme
at
this
stage
it
will
monitor
the
wealth
of
research
focusing
on
this
area
and
may
introduce
personal
carbon
trading
if
the
value
of
carbon
savings
and
cost
implications
change
later
that
same
month
the
uk
parliament
environmental
audit
committee
produced
their
report
on
the
subject
which
concluded
that
personal
carbon
trading
could
be
essential
in
helping
to
reduce
our
national
carbon
footprint
and
rebuked
the
government
for
delaying
a
full
feasibility
study
stating
that
although
we
commend
the
government
for
its
intention
to
maintain
engagement
in
academic
work
on
the
topic
we
urge
it
to
undertake
a
stronger
role
leading
and
shaping
debate
and
coordinating
research
analysts
have
noted
that
to
implement
any
effective
carbon
rationing
system
the
government
must
convince
the
public
that
rationing
levels
are
fair
that
the
system
is
administered
transparently
and
fairly
and
that
evaders
are
few
in
number
likely
to
be
detected
and
liable
to
stiff
penalties
if
found
guilty
a
2010
paper
into
attitudes
towards
personal
carbon
trading
suggests
a
general
ambivalence
however
the
researchers
noted
that
in
fact
moderate
support
was
the
commonest
view
a
4-week
consumer
trial
on
personal
carbon
allowances
carried
out
in
london
in
june
2011

that

with
the
personal

allowance
concept
with
enthusiasm
in

2011
the
uk
all

parliamentary

published
a
report
into

garnering
significant
media
coverage
this
report
highlights
the
significant
research
from
a
number
of
research
centres
produced
since
the
government
pre-feasibility
study
and
argues
that
these
studies
demonstrate
the
benefits
of
to
be
far
greater
than
was
acknowledged
in
the
government
research
accordingly
it
