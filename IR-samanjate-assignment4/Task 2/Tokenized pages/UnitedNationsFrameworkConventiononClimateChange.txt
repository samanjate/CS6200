the
united
nations
framework
convention
on
climate
change
unfccc
is
an
international
environmental
treaty
negotiated
at
the
earth
summit
in
rio
de
janeiro
from
3
to
14
june
1992
then
entered
into
force
on
21
march
1994
the
unfccc
objective
is
to
stabilize
greenhouse
gas
concentrations
in
the
atmosphere
at
a
level
that
would
prevent
dangerous
anthropogenic
interference
with
the
climate
system
the
framework
set
no
binding
limits
on
greenhouse
gas
emissions
for
individual
countries
and
contains
no
enforcement
mechanisms
instead
the
framework
outlines
how
specific
international
treaties
called
protocols
or
agreements
may
be
negotiated
to
set
binding
limits
on
greenhouse
gases
initially
an
intergovernmental
negotiating
committee
produced
the
text
of
the
framework
convention
during
its
meeting
in
new
york
from
30
april
to
9
may
1992
the
unfccc
was
adopted
on
9
may
1992
and
opened
for
signature
on
4
june
1992
unfccc
has
197
parties
as
of
december
2015
the
convention
enjoys
broad
legitimacy
largely
due
to
its
nearly
universal
membership
the
parties
to
the
convention
have
met
annually
from
1995
in
conferences
of
the
parties
cop
to
assess
progress
in
dealing
with
climate
change
in
1997
the
kyoto
protocol
was
concluded
and
established
legally
binding
obligations
for
developed
countries
to
reduce
their
greenhouse
gas
emissions
in
the
period
2008-2012
the
2010
cancn
agreements
state
that
future
global
warming
should
be
limited
to
below
2.0
c
3.6
f
relative
to
the
pre-industrial
level
the
protocol
was
amended
in
2012
to
encompass
the
period
2013-2020
in
the
doha
amendment
which
of
december
2015
not
entered
into
force
in
2015
the
paris
agreement
was
adopted
governing
emission
reductions
from
2020
on
through
commitments
of
countries
in
ambitious
nationally
determined
contributions
one
of
the
first
tasks
set
by
the
unfccc
was
for
signatory
nations
to
establish
national
greenhouse
gas
inventories
of
greenhouse
gas
ghg
emissions
and
removals
which
were
used
to
create
the
1990
benchmark
levels
for
accession
of
annex
i
countries
to
the
kyoto
protocol
and
for
the
commitment
of
those
countries
to
ghg
reductions
updated
inventories
must
be
regularly
submitted
by
annex
i
countries
the
unfccc
is
also

unfccc
was
opened
for
signature
at
the
1992
united

conference
on
environment
and
development
unced
in
rio
de

known
by
its
popular
title
the
earth
summit
on
12
june
1992
154
nations
signed
the
unfccc
that
upon
ratification
committed
signatories
governments
to
reduce
atmospheric
concentrations
of
greenhouse
gases
with
the
goal
of
preventing
dangerous
anthropogenic
interference
with
earth
climate
system
this
commitment
would
require
substantial
reductions
in
greenhouse
gas
emissions
see
the
later
section
stabilization
of
greenhouse
gas
concentrations
article
31
of
the
convention
states
that
parties
should
act
to
protect
the
climate
system
on
the
basis
of
common
but
differentiated
responsibilities
and
that
developed
country
parties
should
take
the
lead
in
addressing
climate
change
under
article
4
all
parties
make
general
commitments
to
address
climate
change
through
for
example
climate
change
mitigation
and
adapting
to
the
eventual
impacts
of
climate
change
article
47
states
the
extent
to
which
developing
country
parties
will
effectively
implement
their
commitments
under
the
convention
will
depend
on
the
effective
implementation
by
developed
country
parties
of
their
commitments
under
the
convention
related
to
financial
resources
and
transfer
of
technology
and
will
take
fully
into
account
that
economic
and
social
development
and
poverty
eradication
are
the
first
and
overriding
priorities
of

decided
that
the
aim
of

stabilizing
their
emissions
at
1990
levels
by
the
year
2000
was
not
adequate
and
further
discussions
at
later
conferences
led
to
the
kyoto
protocol
the
kyoto
protocol
sets
emissions
targets
for
developed

which
are
binding
under
international
law
the
kyoto
protocol
has
had
two
commitment
periods
the
first
of
which
lasted
from
2008-2012
the
second
one
runs
from
2013-2020
and
is
based
on
the
doha
amendment
to
the
protocol
which
has
not
entered
into
force
the
us
has
not
ratified
the
kyoto

by
55
countries
representing

emissions
in
addition
to
the
kyoto
protocol
and
its
amendment
and
the
paris
agreement
parties
to
the

have
agreed
to
further
commitments
during

these
include
the

of
the
bali
action
plan
adopted
in
2007
all
developed

parties
have
agreed
to
quantified
emission
limitation
and
reduction
objectives
while
ensuring
the
comparability
of
efforts
among

taking
into

supported
and
enabled
by
technology
financing
and
capacity-building
in
a
measurable
reportable
and
verifiable
manner
42
developed
countries
have
submitted
mitigation
targets
to
the
unfccc
secretariat
as
have
57
developing
countries
and
the
african
group
a
group
of
countries
within
the
un
as
part
of
the
2009
copenhagen
negotiations
a
number
of
countries
produced
the
copenhagen
accord
the
accord
states
that
global
warming
should
be
limited
to
below
2.0
c
3.6
f
this
may
be
strengthened
in
2015
with
a
target
to
limit
warming
to
below
1.5
c
the
accord
does
not
specify
what
the
baseline
is
for
these
temperature
targets
eg
relative
to
pre-industrial
or
1990
temperatures
according
to
the
unfccc
these
targets
are
relative
to
pre-industrial
temperatures
114
countries
agreed
to
the
accord
the
unfccc
secretariat
notes
that
some
parties
stated
in
their
communications
to
the
secretariat
specific
understandings
on
the
nature
of
the
accord
and
related
matters
based
on
which
they
have
agreed
to
the
accord
the
accord
was
not
formally
adopted
by
the
conference
of
the
parties
instead
the
cop
took
note
of
the
copenhagen
accord
as
part
of
the
accord
17
developed
country
parties
and
the
eu-27
have
submitted
mitigation
targets
as
have
45
developing
country
parties
some
developing
country
parties
have
noted
the
need
for
international
support
in
their
plans
as
part
of
the
cancn
agreements
developed
and
developing
countries
have
submitted
mitigation
plans
to
the
unfccc
these
plans
are
compiled
with
those
made
as
part
of
the
bali
action
plan
at
berlin
cancn
and
durban
the
development
needs
of
developing
country
parties
were
reiterated
for
example
the
durban
platform
reaffirms
that
social
and
economic
development
and
poverty
eradication
are
the
first
and
overriding
priorities
of
developing
country
parties
and
that
a
low-emission
development
strategy
is
central
to
sustainable
development
and
that
the
share
of
global
emissions
originating
in
developing
countries
will
grow
to
meet
their
social
and
development
needs
the
ultimate
objective
of
the
framework
convention
is
to
prevent
dangerous
anthropogenic
ie
human-caused
interference
of
the
climate
system
as
is
stated
in
article
2
of
the
convention
this
requires
that
ghg
concentrations
are
stabilized
in
the
atmosphere
at
a
level
where
ecosystems
can
adapt
naturally
to
climate
change
food
production
is

scientific
analysis
can
provide
information
on
the
risks
of
climate

but
deciding
which
risks
are
dangerous
requires
value
judgements
the
global
warming
that
has
already
occurred
poses
a
risk
to
some
human
and
natural
systems
eg
coral

higher

will
generally
increase
the
risk
of
negative

according

climate
change
risks
are
considerable
with

would
lead
to
significantly
increased
risks
with
potential
impacts
including
widespread
loss
of

and
reduced
global
and
regional
food
security
climate

policies
may
lead
to
costs
that
are
relevant
to
article
2
for
example
more
stringent
policies
to
control
ghg
emissions
may
reduce
the
risk
of
more
severe
climate
change
but
may
also
be
more
expensive
to
implement
there
is
considerable
uncertainty
over
future
changes
in
anthropogenic
ghg
emissions
atmospheric
ghg
concentrations
and
associated
climate
change
without
mitigation
policies
increased
energy
demand
and
extensive
use
of
fossil
fuels
could
lead
to
global
warming
in

uncertainty
to
have
a
likely
chance
of

ghg
concentrations
would
need
to
be
limited

the
current
trajectory
of

does
not
appear
to
be
consistent

c
in
decision
making
the
precautionary
principle
is
considered
when
possibly
dangerous
irreversible
or
catastrophic
events
are
identified
but
scientific
evaluation
of
the
potential
damage
is
not
sufficiently
certain
toth

the
precautionary
principle
implies
an
emphasis
on
the
need
to
prevent
such
adverse
effects
uncertainty
is
associated
with
each
link
of
the
causal
chain
of
climate
change
for
example
future
ghg
emissions
are
uncertain
as
are
climate

damages
however
following
the
precautionary
principle
uncertainty
is
not
a
reason
for
inaction

a
conventional
environmental
issueit
implicates
virtually
every
aspect
of
a
state
economy
so
it
makes
countries
nervous
about
growth
and
development
this
is
an
economic
issue
every
bit
as
it
is
an
environmental
one
he
went
on
to
explain
that
the
united
nations
framework
convention
on
climate
change
is
a
multilateral
body
concerned
with
climate
change
and
can
be
an
inefficient
system
for
enacting
international
policy
because
the
framework
system
includes
over
190
countries
and
because
negotiations
are
governed
by
consensus
small
groups
of
countries
can
often
block
progress
the
failure
to
achieve
meaningful
progress
and
reach
effective-co2
reducing-policy
treaties
among
the
parties
over
the
past
eighteen
years
have
driven
some
countries
like
the
united
states
to
never
ratify
the
unfccc
largest
body
of
work
the
kyoto
protocol
in
large
part
because
the
treaty
didn
cover
developing
countries
who
now
include
the
largest
co2
emitters
however
this
fails
to
consider
the
historical
responsibility
for
climate
change
since
industrialisation
which
is
a
contentious
issue
in
the
talks
and
the
responsibility
of
emissions
from
consumption
and
importation
of
goods
it
has
also
led
canada
to
withdraw
from
the
kyoto
protocol
out
of
a
desire
to
not
force
its
citizens
to
pay
penalties
that
would
result
in
wealth
transfers
out
of
canada
canada
formally
withdrew
from
the
kyoto
protocol
in
2011
both
the
us
and
canada
are
looking
at
voluntary
emissions
reduction
schemes
that
they
can
implement
internally
to
curb
carbon
dioxide
emissions
outside
the
kyoto
protocol
the
perceived
lack
of
progress
has
also
led
some
countries
to
seek
and
focus
on
alternative
high-value
activities
like
the
creation
of
the
climate
and
clean
air
coalition
to
reduce
short-lived
climate
pollutants
which
seeks
to
regulate
short-lived
pollutants
such
as
methane
black
carbon
and
hydrofluorocarbons
hfcs
which
together
are
believed
to
account
for
up
to
1/3
of
current
global
warming
but
whose
regulation
is
not
as
fraught
with
wide
economic
impacts
and
opposition
in
2010
japan
stated
that
it
will
not
sign
up
to
a
second
kyoto
term
because
it
would
impose
restrictions
on
it
not
faced
by
its
main
economic
competitors
china
india
and
indonesia
a
similar
indication
was
given
by
the
prime
minister
of
new
zealand
in
november
2012
at
the
2012
conference
last
minute
objections
at
the
conference
by
russia
ukraine
belarus
and
kazakhstan
were
ignored
by
the
governing
officials
and
they
have
indicated
that
they
will
likely
withdraw
or
not
ratify
the
treaty
these
defections
place
additional
pressures
on
the
unfccc
process
that
is
seen
by
some
as
cumbersome
and
expensive
in
the
uk
alone
the
climate
change
department
has
taken
over
3,000
flights
in
two
years
at
a
cost
of
over
1,300,000
british
pounds
before
the
2015
united
nations
climate
change
conference
national
geographic
magazine
added
criticism
writing
since
1992
when
the
worlds
nations
agreed
at
rio
de
janeiro
to
avoid
anthropogenic
interference
with
the
climate
system
theyve
met
20
times
without
moving
the
needle
on
carbon
emissions
in
that
interval
weve
added
almost
as
much
carbon
to
the
atmosphere
as
we
did
in
the
previous
century
benchmarking
is
the
setting
of
a
policy
target
based
on
some
frame
of
reference
an
example
of
benchmarking
is
the
unfccc
original
target
of
annex
i
parties
limiting
their
greenhouse
gas
emissions
at
1990
levels
by
the
year
2000
goldemberg
et
al
1996
commented
on
the
economic
implications
of
this
target
although
the
target
applies
equally
to
all
annex
i
parties
the
economic
costs
of
meeting
the
target
would
likely
vary
between
parties
for
example
countries
with
initially
high
levels
of
energy
efficiency
might
find
it
more
costly
to
meet
the
target
than
countries
with
lower
levels
of
energy
efficiency
from
this
perspective
the
unfccc
target
could
be
viewed
as
inequitable
ie
unfair
benchmarking
has
also
been
discussed
in
relation
to
the
first-round
emissions
targets
specified
in

kyoto
protocol
