convention
the
convention
on
biological
diversity
cbd
known
informally
as
the
biodiversity
convention
is
a
multilateral
treaty
the
convention
has
three
main
goals
in
other
words
its
objective
is
to
develop
national
strategies
for
the
conservation
and
sustainable
use
of
biological
diversity
it
is
often
seen
as
the
key
document
regarding
sustainable
development
the
convention
was
opened
for
signature
at
the
earth
summit
in
rio
de
janeiro
on
5
june
1992
and
entered
into
force
on
29
december
1993
at
the
2010
10th
conference
of
parties
cop
to
the
convention
on
biological
diversity
in
october
in
nagoya
japan
the
nagoya
protocol
was
adopted
the
convention
recognized
for
the
first
time
in
international
law
that
the
conservation
of
biological
diversity
is
a
common
concern
of
humankind
and
is
an
integral
part
of
the
development
process
the
agreement
covers
all
ecosystems
species
and
genetic
resources
it
links
traditional
conservation
efforts
to
the
economic
goal
of
using
biological
resources
sustainably
it
sets
principles
for
the
fair
and
equitable
sharing
of
the
benefits
arising
from
the
use
of
genetic
resources
notably
those
destined
for
commercial
use
it
also
covers
the
rapidly
expanding
field
of
biotechnology
through
its
cartagena
protocol
on
biosafety
addressing
technology
development
and
transfer
benefit-sharing
and
biosafety
issues
importantly
the
convention
is
legally
binding
countries
that
join
it
are
obliged
to
implement
its
provisions
the
convention
reminds
decision-makers
that
natural
resources
are
not
infinite
and
sets
out
a
philosophy
of
sustainable
use
while
past
conservation
efforts
were
aimed
at
protecting
particular
species
and
habitats
the
convention
recognizes
that
ecosystems
species
and
genes
must
be
used
for
the
benefit
of
humans
however
this
should
be
done
in
a
way
and
at
a
rate
that
does
not
lead
to
the
long-term
decline
of
biological
diversity
the
convention
also
offers
decision-makers
guidance
based
on
the
precautionary
principle
that
where
there
is
a
threat
of
significant
reduction
or
loss
of
biological
diversity
lack
of
full
scientific
certainty
should
not
be
used
as
a
reason
for
postponing
measures
to
avoid
or
minimize
such
a
threat
the
convention
acknowledges
that
substantial
investments
are
required
to
conserve
biological
diversity
it
argues
however
that
conservation
will
bring
us
significant
environmental
economic
and
social
benefits
in
return
the
convention
on
biological
diversity
of
2010
would
ban
some
forms
of
geoengineering
some
of
the
many
issues
dealt
with
under
the
convention
include
the
cartagena
protocol
on
biosafety
of
the
convention
also
known
as
the
biosafety
protocol
was
adopted
in
january
2000
the
biosafety
protocol
seeks
to
protect
biological
diversity
from
the
potential
risks
posed
by
living
modified
organisms
resulting
from
modern
biotechnology
the
biosafety
protocol
makes
clear
that
products
from
new
technologies
must
be
based
on
the
precautionary
principle
and
allow
developing
nations
to
balance
public
health
against
economic
benefits
it
will
for
example
let
countries
ban
imports
of
a
genetically
modified
organism
if
they
feel
there
is
not
enough
scientific
evidence
the
product
is
safe
and
requires
exporters
to
label
shipments
containing
genetically
modified
commodities
such
as
corn
or
cotton
the
required
number
of
50
instruments

shows
that

this
