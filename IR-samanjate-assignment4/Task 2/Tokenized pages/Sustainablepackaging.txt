sustainable
sustainable
packaging
is
the
development
and
use
of
packaging
which
results
in
improved
sustainability
this
involves
increased
use
of
life
cycle
inventory
lci
and
life
cycle
assessment
lca
to
help
guide
the
use
of
packaging
which
reduces
the
environmental
impact
and
ecological
footprint
it
includes
a
look
at
the
whole
of
the
supply
chain
from
basic
function
to
marketing
and
then
through
to
end
of
life
lca
and
rebirth
additionally
an
eco-cost
to
value
ratio
can
be
useful
the
goals
are
to
improve
the
long
term
viability
and
quality
of
life
for
humans
and
the
longevity
of
natural
ecosystems
sustainable
packaging
must
meet
the
functional
and
economic
needs
of
the
present
without
compromising
the
ability
of
future
generations
to
meet
their
own
needs
sustainability
is
not
necessarily
an
end
state
but
is
a
continuing
process
of
improvement
sustainable
packaging
is
a
relatively
new
addition
to
the
environmental
considerations
for
packaging
see
packaging
and
labeling
it
requires
more
analysis
and
documentation
to
look
at
the
package
design
choice
of
materials
processing
and
life-cycle
this
is
not
just
the
vague
green
movement
that
many
businesses
and
companies
have
been
trying
to
include
over
the
past
years
companies
implementing
these
eco-friendly
actions
are
reducing
their
carbon
footprint
using
more
recycled
materials
and
reusing
more
package
components
they
often
encourage
suppliers
contract
packagers
and
distributors
to
do
likewise
for
example
researchers
at
the
agricultural
research
service
are
looking
into
using
dairy-based
films
as
an
alternative
to
petroleum-based
packaging
instead
of
being
made
of
synthetic
polymers
these
dairy-based
films
would
be
composed
of
proteins
such
as
casein
and
whey
which
are
found
in
milk
the
films
would
be
biodegradable
and
offer
better
oxygen
barriers
than
synthetic
chemical-based
films
more
research
must
be
done
to
improve
the
water
barrier
quality
of
the
dairy-based
film
but
advances
in
sustainable
packaging
are
actively
being
pursued
environmental
marketing
claims
on
packages
need
to
be
made
and
read
with
caution
ambiguous
greenwashing
titles
such
as
green
packaging
and
environmentally
friendly
can
be
confusing
without
specific
definition
some
regulators
such
as
the
us
federal
trade
commission
are
providing
guidance
to
packagers
companies
have
long
been
reusing
and
recycling
packaging
when
economically
viable
using
minimal
packaging
has
also
been
a
common
goal
to
help
reduce
costs
recent
years
have
accelerated
these
efforts
based
on
social
movements
consumer
pressure
and
regulation
all
phases
of
packaging
distribution
and
logistics
are
included
sustainable
packaging
is
no
longer
focused
on
just
recycling
just
as
packaging
is
not
the
only
eco
target
although
it
is
still
top
of
mind
for
many
right
or
wrong
packaging
is
frequently
scrutinized
and
used
as
the
measure
of
a
company
overall
sustainability
even
though
it
may
contribute
only
a
small
percentage
to
the
total
eco
impact
compared
to
other
things
such
as
transportation
and
water
and
energy
use
the
criteria
for
ranking
and
comparing
packaging
based
on
their
sustainability
is
an
active
area
of
development
general
guidance
metrics
checklists
and
scorecards
are
being
published
by
several
groups
government
standards
organizations
consumers
retailers
and
packagers
are
considering
several
types
of
criteria
each
organization
words
the
goals
and
targets
a
little
differently
in
general
the
broad
goals
of
sustainable
packaging
are
specific
factors
for
sustainable
design
of
packaging
may
include
the
chosen
criteria
are
often
used
best
as
a
basis
of
comparison
for
two
or
more
similar
packaging
designs
not
as
an
absolute
success
or
failure
such
a
multi-variable
comparison
is
often
presented
as
a
radar
chart
spider
chart
star
chart
etc
some
aspects
of
environmentally
sound
packaging
are
required
by
regulators
while
others
are
decisions
made
by
each
packager
investors
employees
management
and
customers
can
influence
corporate
decisions
and
help
set
policies
when
investors
seek
to
purchase
stock
companies
known
for
their
positive
environmental
policy
can
be
attractive
potential
stockholders
and
investors
see
this
as
a
solid
decision
lower
environmental
risks
lead
to
more
capital
at
cheaper
rates
companies
that
highlight
their
environmental
status
to
consumers
can
boost
sales
as
well
as
product
reputation
going
green
is
often
a
sound
investment
that
can
pay
off
the
process
of
engineering
more
environmentally
acceptable
packages
can
include
consideration
of
the
costs
some
companies
claim
that
their
environmental
packaging
program
is
cost
effective
some
alternative
materials
that
are
recycledrecyclable
andor
less
damaging
to
the
environment
can
lead
to
companies
incurring
increased
costs
though
this
is
common
when
any
product
begins
to
carry
the
true
cost
of
its
production
producer

laws

there
may
be
an
expensive
and
lengthy
process
before
the
new
forms
of
packaging
are
deemed
safe
to
the
public
and
approval
may
take
up
to
two
years
it
is

the
question
is

should
become

how-to
and
how-soon
to
do
it
efforts
toward
greener
packaging
are
supported
in
the

these

only
as
