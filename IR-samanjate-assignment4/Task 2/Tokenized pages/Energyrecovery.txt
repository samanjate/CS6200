energy
energy
recovery
includes
any
technique
or
method
of
minimizing
the
input
of
energy
to
an
overall
system
by
the
exchange
of
energy
from
one
sub-system
of
the
overall
system
with
another
the
energy
can
be
in
any
form
in
either
subsystem
but
most
energy
recovery
systems
exchange
thermal
energy
in
either
sensible
or
latent
form
in
some
circumstances
the
use
of
an
enabling
technology
either
diurnal
thermal
energy
storage
or
seasonal
thermal
energy
storage
stes
which
allows
heat
or
cold
storage
between
opposing
seasons
is
necessary
to
make
energy
recovery
practicable
one
example
is
waste
heat
from
air
conditioning
machinery
stored
in
a
buffer
tank
to
aid
in
night
time
heating
another
is
an
stes
application
at
a
foundry
in
sweden
waste
heat
is
recovered
and
stored
in
a
large
mass
of
native
bedrock
which
is
penetrated
by
a
cluster
of
140
heat
exchanger
equipped
boreholes
155mm
diameter
that
are
150m
deep
this
store
is
used
for
heating
an
adjacent
factory
as
needed
even
months
later
an
example
of
using
stes
to
recover
and
utilize
natural
heat
that
otherwise
would
be
wasted
is
the
drake
landing
solar
community
in
alberta
canada
the
community
uses
a
cluster
of
boreholes
in
bedrock
for
interseasonal
heat
storage
and
this
enables
obtaining
97
percent
of
the
year-round
space
heating
from
solar
thermal
collectors
on
the
garage
roofs
another
stes
application
is
recovering
the
cold
of
winter
by
circulating
water
through
a
dry
cooling
tower
and
using
that
to
chill
a
deep
aquifer
or
borehole
cluster
the
chill
is
later
recovered
from
the
storage
for
summer
air
conditioning
with
a
coefficient
of
performance
cop
of
20
to
40
this
method
of
cooling
can
be
ten
times
more
efficient
than
conventional
air
conditioning
a
common
application
of
this
principle
is
in
systems
which
have
an
exhaust
stream
or
waste
stream
which
is
transferred
from
the
system
to
its
surroundings
some
of
the
energy
in
that
flow
of
material
often
gaseous
or
liquid
may
be
transferred
to
the
make-up
or
input
material
flow
this
input
mass
flow
often
comes
from
the
system
surroundings
which
being
at
ambient
conditions
are
at
a
lower
temperature
than
the
waste
stream
this
temperature
differential
allows
heat
transfer
and
thus
energy
transfer
or
in
this
case
recovery
thermal
energy
is
often
recovered
from
liquid
or
gaseous
waste
streams
to
fresh
make-up
air
and
water
intakes
in
buildings
such
as
for
the
hvac
systems
or
process
systems
energy
consumption
is
a
key
part
of
most
human
activities
this
consumption
involves
converting
one
energy
system
to
another
for
example
the
conversion
of
mechanical
energy
to
electrical
energy
which
can
then
power
computers
light
motors
etc
the
input
energy
propels
the
work
and
is
mostly
converted
to
heat
or
follows
the
product
in
the
process
as
output
energy
energy
recovery
systems
harvest
the
output
power
and
providing
this
as
input
power
to
the
same
or
another
process
an
energy
recovery
system
will
close
this
energy
cycle
to
prevent
the
input
power
from
being
released
back
to
nature
and
rather
be
used
in
other
forms
of
desired
work
there
is
a
large
potential
for
energy
recovery
in
compact
systems
like
large
industries
and
utilities
together
with
energy
conservation
it
should
be
possible
to
dramatically
reduce
world
energy
consumption
the
effect
of
this
will
then
be
in
2008
tom
casten
chairman
of
recycled
energy
development
said
that
we
think
we
could
make
about
19
to
20
percent
of
us
electricity
with
heat
that
is
currently
thrown
away
by
industry
a
2007
department
of
energy
study
found
the
potential
for
135,000
megawatts
of
combined
heat
and
power
which
uses
energy
recovery
in
the
us
and
a
lawrence
berkley
national
laboratory
study
identified
about
64,000
megawatts
that
could
be
obtained
from
industrial
waste
energy
not
counting
chp
these
studies
suggest
about
200,000
megawattsor
20
of
total
power
capacity
that
could
come
from
energy
recycling
in
the
us
widespread
use
of
energy
recycling
could
therefore
reduce
global
warming
emissions
by
an
estimated
20
percent
indeed
as
of
2005
about
42
percent
of
us
greenhouse
gas
pollution
came
from
the
production
of
electricity
and
27
percent
from
the
production
of
heat
it
is
however
difficult
to
quantify
the
environmental
impact
of
a
global
energy

in
some
sectors
the
main

it
