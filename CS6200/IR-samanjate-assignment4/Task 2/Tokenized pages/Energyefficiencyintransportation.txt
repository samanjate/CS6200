a

food

fuel
the
energy
incurred
in
disposing
of

and
the

of

the

this
last
can
be
significant
given
that
walking
requires
little
or
no
special
equipment
while
automobiles
for
example
require
a
great
deal
of
energy
to
produce
and
have
relatively
short
lifespans
in
addition
any
comparison
of
electric
vehicles
and
liquid-fuelled
vehicles
must
include
the
fuel
consumed
in
the
power
station
to
generate
the
electricity
in
the
uk
for
instance
the
efficiency
of
the
electricity

system
is
around

automobile
fuel
efficiency
is
most
commonly
expressed
in
terms
of
the
volume
of
fuel
consumed
per
one
hundred
kilometres
l/100
km
but
in
some
countries
including
the

it
is
more
commonly
expressed
in
terms
of
the
distance
per
volume
fuel
consumed
kml
or
miles
per

or
imperial

this
is
complicated
by
the
different
energy
content
of
fuels
such
as
petrol
and

compared
to

for

a
second
important
consideration
is
the
energy
costs
of
producing
energy
bio-fuels
electricity
and
hydrogen
for
instance
have
significant
energy
inputs
in
their
production
because
of
this
the
5070
efficiency
of
hydrogen
production
has
to
be
combined
with
the
vehicle
efficiency
to
yield
net
efficiency
a
third
consideration
to
take
into
account
is
the
occupancy
rate
of
the
vehicle
as
the
number
of
passengers
per
vehicle
increases
the
consumption
per
unit
distance
per
vehicle
increases
however
this
increase
is
slight
compared
to
the
reduction
in
consumption
per
unit
distance
per
passenger
we
can
compare
for
instance
the
estimated
average
occupancy
rate
of
about
1.3
passengers
per
car
in
the
san
francisco
bay
area
to
the
2006

estimated

of
1.58
finally
vehicle
energy
efficiency
calculations
would
be
misleading
without
factoring
the
energy
cost
of
producing
the
vehicle
itself
this
initial
energy
cost
can
of
course
be
depreciated
over
the
life
of
the
vehicle
to
calculate
an
average
energy
efficiency
over
its
effective
life
span
in
other
words
vehicles
that
take
a
lot
of
energy
to
produce
and
are
used
for
relatively
short
periods
will
require
a
great
deal
more
energy
over
their
effective
lifespan
than
those
that
do
not
and
are
therefore
much
less
energy
efficient
than
they
may
otherwise
seem
compare
for

walking

requires
no
