the

rmi
is
headquartered

offices
in

china
in
1978
experimental
physicist
amory
lovins
had
published
many
books
consulted
widely
and
was
active
in
energy
affairs
in
some
fifteen
countries
as
synthesist
and
lobbyist
lovins
is
a
main
theorist
of
the
soft
energy
path
later
in
1979
lovins
married
l
hunter
sheldon
a
lawyer
forester
and
social
scientist
hunter
received
her
undergraduate
degree
in
sociology
and
political
studies
from
pitzer
college
and
her
jd
from
loyola
marymount
school
of
law
in
1982
amory
and
hunter
founded
rocky
mountain
institute
based
in
colorado
together
with
a
group
of
colleagues
the
lovinses
fostered
efficient
resource
use
and
policy
development
that
they
believed
would
promote
global
security
rmi
ultimately
grew
into
an
organization
with
a
staff
of
around
fifty
by
the
mid
1980s
the
lovinses
were
being
featured
on
major
network
tv
programs
such
as
60
minutes
at
rmi
headquarters
the
south-facing
building
complex
is
so
energy-efficient
that
even
with
local
f
c
winter
temperatures
the
building
interiors
can
maintain
a
comfortable
temperature
solely
from
the
sunlight
admitted
plus
the
body
heat
of
the
people
who
work
there
the
environment
can
actually
nurture
semi-tropical
and
tropical
indoor
plants
the
lovinses
described
the
hard
energy
path
as
involving
inefficient
liquid-fuel
automotive
transport
as
well
as
giant
centralized
electricity-generating
facilities
often
burning
fossil
fuels
such
as
coal
or
petroleum
or
harnessing
a
fission
reaction
greatly
complicated
by
electricity
wastage
and
loss
the
soft
energy
path
which
they
wholly
preferred
involves
efficient
use
of
energy
diversity
of
energy
production
methods
and
matched
in
scale
and
quality
to
end
uses
and
special
reliance
on
soft
technologies
alternative
technology
such
as
solar
wind
biofuels
and
geothermal
according
to
the
institute
large-scale
electricity
production
facilities
had
an
important
place
but
it
was
a
place
that
they
were
already
filling
in
the
middle
1970s
in
general
more
would
not
be
needed
in
a
1989
speech
amory
lovins
introduced
the
related
concept
of
negawatt
power
in
which
the
creation
of
a
market
for
trading
increased
efficiency
could
supply
additional
electrical
energy
to
consumers
without
increasing
generation
capacitysuch
as
building
more
power
plants
in
recent
years
rmi
has
convened
a
team
of
designers
and
engineers
to
develop
a
super-efficient
prototype
automobile
which
they
dubbed
the
hypercar
in
december
2014
rmi
merged
with
carbon

organization

goals
