list
this
is
a
list
of
energy
storage
projects
worldwide
many
individual
energy
storage
projects
augment
electrical
grids
by
capturing
excess
electrical
energy
during
periods
of
low
demand
and
storing
it
in
other
forms
until
needed
on
an
electrical
grid
the
energy
is
later
converted
back
to
its
electrical
form
and
returned
to
the
grid
as
needed
another
energy
storage
method
is
the
consumption
of
surplus
or
low-cost
energy
typically
during
night
time
for
conversion
into
resources
such
as
hot
water
cool
water
or
ice
which
is
then
used
for
heating
or
cooling
at
other
times
when
electricity
is
in
higher
demand
and
at
greater
cost
per
kilowatt
hour
kwh
such
thermal
energy
storage
is
often
employed
at
end-user
sites
such
as
large
buildings
and
also
as
part
of
district
heating
thus
energy
consumption
to
other
times
for
better
balancing
of
supply
and
demand
