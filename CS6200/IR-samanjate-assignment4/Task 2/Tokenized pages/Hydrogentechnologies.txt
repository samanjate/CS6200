hydrogen
technologies
are
technologies
that
relate
to
the
production
and
use
of
hydrogen
hydrogen
technologies
are
applicable
for
many
uses
some
hydrogen
technologies
are
carbon
neutral
and
could
have
a
role
in
preventing
climate
change
and
a
possible
future
hydrogen
economy
hydrogen
is
a
widely
used
chemical
used
in
various
applications
including
ammonia
production
oil
refining
and
energy
hydrogen
is
not
a
primary
energy
source
because
it
is
not
naturally
occurring
as
a
fuel
it
is
however
widely
regarded
as
an
ideal
energy
storage
medium
due
to
the
ease
with
which
electric
power
can
convert
water
into
its
hydrogen
and
oxygen
components
through
electrolysis
and
can
be
converted
back
to
electrical
power
using
a
fuel
cell
there
are
a
wide
number
of
different
types
of
fuel
and
electrolysis
cells
the
potential
environmental
impact
depends
primarily
on
the
