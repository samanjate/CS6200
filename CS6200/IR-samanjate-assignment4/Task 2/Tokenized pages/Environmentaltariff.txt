environmental
an
environmental
tariff
also
known
as
a
green
tariff
or
eco-tariff
is
an
import
or
export
tax
placed
on
products
being
imported
from
or
also
being
sent
to
countries
with
substandard
environmental
pollution
controls
they
can
be
used
as
controls
on
global
pollution
and
can
also
be
considered
as
corrective
measures
against
environmental
races
to
the
bottom
and
eco-dumping
there
has
been
debate
on
the
role
that
increased
international
trade
has
played
in
increasing
pollution
while
some
maintain
that
increases
in
pollution
which
result
in
both
local
environmental
degradation
and
a
global
tragedy
of
the
commons
are
intimately
linked
to
increases
in
international
trade
others
have
argued
that
as
citizens
become
more
affluent
they
also
advocate
for
cleaner
environments
according
to
a
world
bank
paper
although
the
united
states
has
in
the
past
been
accused
of
dragging
its
feet
on
implementing
tough
new
anti-pollution
measures
it
was
the
originator
of
a
legislative
proposal
suggesting
an
environmental
tariff
be
applied
against
exporting
countries
whose
exports
gained
significant
cost
advantages
due
to
less
stringent
environmental
regulations
the
proposed
legislation
was
tabled
as
the
international
pollution
deterrence
act
of
1991
and
was
introduced
in
its
senate
in
april
of
that
year
a
notable
feature
of
the
proposed
us
international
pollution
deterrence
act
was
the
international
pollution
control
index
it
cited
within
its
section
5
which
read
international
pollution
control
index
section
8002
of
the
solid
waste
disposal
act

is
amended
by
adding
the
following
new
subsections
at
the
end
thereof
environment
tariffs
were
not
implemented
in
the
past
in
part
because
they
were
not
sanctioned
by
multilateral
trade
regimes
such
as
the
world
trade
organization
and
within
the
general
agreement
on
tariffs
and
trade
gatt
a
fact
which
generated
considerable
criticism
and
calls
for
reform
additionally
many
foreign
factory
owners
in
newly
industrialized
countries
and
underdeveloped
countries
saw
the
attempts
to
impose
pollution
controls
