sustainable
the
expression
sustainable
art
has
been
promoted
recently
as
an
art
term
that
can
be
distinguished
from
environmental
art
that
is
in
harmony
with
the
key
principles
of
sustainability
which
include
ecology
social
justice
non-violence
and
grassroots
democracy
sustainable
art
may
also
be
understood
as
art
that
is
produced
with
consideration
for
the
wider
impact
of
the
work
and
its
reception
in
relationship
to
its
environments
social
economic
biophysical
historical
and
cultural
according
to
the
contemporary
art
historians
and
curators
maja
and
reuben
fowkes
the
origins
of
sustainable
art
can
be
traced
to
the
conceptual
art
of
the
late
1960s
and
early
1970s
with
its
stress
on
dematerialisation
and
questioning
of
the
functioning
of
the
art
system
they
also
connect
the
rise
of
the
concept
of
sustainability
to
the
ending
of
the
cold
war
in
1989
and
the
emergence
of
a
new
awareness
of
the
global
character
of
ecological
and
social
problems
sustainable
art
adopts
according
to
these
authors
a
critical
position
towards
some
key
practitioners
in
the
land
art
movement
of
the
1960s
who
showed
little
concern
for
the
environmental
consequences
of
eg
treating
the
landscape
like
a
giant
canvas
with
a
bulldozer
for
a
brush
they
have
questioned
the
polemical
division
between
and
art
originating
with
modernism
arguing
that
it
is
that
gives
art
as
well
as
artists
as
social
actors
the
potential
to
be
free
and
able
to
offer
alternatives
to
dominant
ideological
paradigms
since
2005
there
is
a
sustainable
arts
biennale
running
at
ihlienworth
near
hamburg
germany
curated
by
the
german
conceptional
artist
and
curator
samuel
j
fleiner
there
are
a
range
of
interpretations
over
the
relations
between
art
and
sustainability
besides
the
term
art
promoted
by
maja
and
reuben
fowkes
other
authors
prefer
the
broader
notions
of
arts
or
and
sustainability
eg
kagan
and
kirchberg
still
others
explicitly
rejected
the
use
of
the
term
art
referring
instead
to
work
that
inspires
us
to
think
about
sustainability
