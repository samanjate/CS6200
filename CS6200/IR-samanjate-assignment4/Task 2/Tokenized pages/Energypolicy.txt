energy
energy
policy
is
the
manner
in
which
a
given
entity
often
governmental
has
decided
to
address
issues
of
energy
development
including
energy
production
distribution
and
consumption
the
attributes
of
energy
policy
may
include
legislation
international
treaties
incentives
to
investment
guidelines
for
energy
conservation
taxation
and
other
public
policy
techniques
although
research
is
ongoing
the
human
dimensions
of
energy
use
are
of
increasing
interest
to
business
utilities
and
policymakers
using
the
social
sciences
to
gain
insights
into
energy
consumer
behavior
can
empower
policymakers
to
make
better
decisions
about
broad-based
climate
and
energy
options
this
could
facilitate
more
efficient
energy
use
renewable
energy
commercialization
and
carbon
emission
reductions
a
national
energy
policy
comprises
a
set
of
measures
involving
that
country
laws
treaties
and
agency
directives
the
energy
policy
of
a
sovereign
nation
may
include
one
or
more
of
the
following
measures
frequently
the
dominant
issue
of
energy
policy
is
the
risk
of
supply-demand
mismatch
see
energy
crisis
current
energy
policies
also
address
environmental
issues
see
climate
change
particularly
challenging
because
of
the
need
to
reconcile
global
objectives
and
international
rules
with
domestic
needs
and
laws
some
governments
state
explicit
energy
policy
but
declared
or
not
each
government
practices
some
type
of
energy
policy
economic
and
energy
modelling
can
be
used
by
governmental
or
inter-governmental
bodies
as
an
advisory
and
analysis
tool
see

model
poles
there
are
a
number
of
elements
that
are
naturally
contained
in
a
national
energy
policy
regardless
of
which
of
the
above
measures
was
used
to
arrive
at
the
resultant
policy
the
chief
elements
intrinsic
to
an
energy
policy
are
even
within
a
state
it
is
proper
to
talk
about
energy
policies
in
plural
influential
entities
such
as
municipal
or
regional
governments
and
energy
industries
will
each
exercise
policy
policy
measures
available
to
these
entities
are
lesser
in
sovereignty
but
may
be
equally
important
to
national
measures
in
fact
there
are
certain
activities
vital
to
energy
policy
which
realistically
cannot
be
administered
at
the
national
level
such
as
monitoring
energy
conservation
practices
in
the
process
of
building
construction
which
is
normally
controlled
by
state-regional
and
municipal
building
codes
although
can
appear
basic
federal
legislation
brazil
is
the
10th
largest
energy
consumer
in
the
world
and
the
largest
in
south
america
at
the
same
time
it
is
an
important
oil
and
gas
producer
in
the
region
and
the

second
largest
ethanol
fuel
producer
the
governmental
agencies
responsible
for

policy
are

are
the

although
the
european
union
has
legislated
set
targets
and
negotiated
internationally
in
the
area
of
energy
policy
for
many
years
and
evolved
out
of
the
european
coal
and
steel
community
the
concept
of
introducing
a
mandatory
common
european
union
energy
policy
was
only
approved
at
the
meeting
of
the
european
council
on
october
27
2005
in
london
following
this
the
first
policy
proposals
energy
for
a
changing
world
were
published
by
the
european
commission
on
january

2007
the
most
well
known
energy
policy
objectives
in
the
eu
are
20/20/20
objectives
binding
for
all
eu
member
states
the
eu
is
planning
to
increase
the
share
of
renewable
energy
in
its
final
energy
use
to
20
reduce
greenhouse
gases
by

and
increase
energy
efficiency
by

in
september
2010
the
german
government
adopted
a
set
of
ambition
goals
to
transform
their
national
energy
system
and
to
reduce
national
greenhouse
gas
emissions
by
80
to
95
by
2050
relative
to
1990
this
transformation
become
known
as
the
energiewende
subsequently
the
government
decided
to
the
phase-out
the
nation
fleet
of
nuclear
reactors
to
be
complete
by
2022
as
of
2014
the
country
is
making
steady
progress
on
this
transition
the
energy
policy
of
the
united
kingdom
has
achieved
success
in
reducing
energy
intensity
but
still
really
high
reducing
energy
poverty
and
maintaining
energy
supply
reliability
to
date
the
united
kingdom
has
an
ambitious
goal
to
reduce
carbon
dioxide
emissions
for
future
years
but
it
is
unclear
whether
the
programs
in
place
are
sufficient
to
achieve
this
objective
the
way
to
be
so
efficient
as
france
is
still
hard
regarding
energy
self
sufficiency
the
united
kingdom
policy
does
not
address
this
issue
other
than
to
concede
historic
energy
self
sufficiency
is
currently
ceasing
to
exist
due
to
the
decline
of
the
north
sea
oil
production
with
regard
to
transport
the
united
kingdom
historically
has
a
good
policy
record
encouraging
public
transport
links
with
cities
despite
encountering
problems
with
high
speed
trains
which
have
the
potential
to
reduce
dramatically
domestic
and
short-haul
european
flights
the
policy
does
not
however
significantly
encourage
hybrid
vehicle
use
or
ethanol
fuel
use
options
which
represent
viable
short
term
means
to
moderate
rising
transport
fuel
consumption
regarding
renewable
energy
the
united
kingdom
has
goals
for
wind
and
tidal
energy
the
white
paper
on

2007
set
the
target
that
20
of
the
uk
energy
must
come
from
renewable
sources
by

the
soviet
union
was
the
largest
energy
provider
in
the
world
until
the

1980s
russia
one

superpowers

exporter
and

the
main
document
defining
the
energy
policy
of
russia
is
the
energy
strategy
which
initially
set
out
policy
for
the
period
up
to
2020
later
was
reviewed
amended
and
prolonged
up
to
2030
while
russia
has
also
signed
and
ratified
the
kyoto
protocol
the
energy
policy
of
india
is
characterized
by
trades
between
four
major
drivers
in
recent
years
these
challenges
have
led
to
a
major
set
of
continuing
reforms
restructuring
and
a
focus
on
energy
conservation
the
energy
policy
of
thailand
is
characterized
by
1
increasing
energy
consumption
efficiency
2
increasing
domestic
energy
production
3
increasing
the
private
sector
role
in
the
energy
sector
4
increasing
the
role
of
market
mechanisms
in
setting
energy
prices
these
policies
have
been
consistent
since
the
1990s
despite
various
changes
in
governments
the
pace
and
form
of
industry
liberalization
and
privatization
has
been
highly
controversial
the
first
national
energy
policy
nep
of
bangladesh
was
formulated
in
1996
by
the
ministry
of
power
energy
and
mineral
resources
to
ensure
proper
exploration
production
distribution
and
rational
use
of

resources
to

of
different
zones
consuming
sectors
and
consumers
groups
on
a
sustainable
basis
with
rapid
change
of
global
as
well
as
domestic
situation
the
policy
was
updated
in
2004
the
updated

included
additional
objectives
namely
to
ensure
environmentally
sound
sustainable
energy
development
programmes
causing

to
