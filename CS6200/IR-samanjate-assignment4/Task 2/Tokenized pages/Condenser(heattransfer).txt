condenser
in
systems
involving
heat
transfer
a
condenser
is
a
device
or
unit
used
to
condense
a
substance
from
its
gaseous
to
its
liquid
state
by
cooling
it
in
so
doing
the
latent
heat
is
given
up
by
the
substance
and
will
transfer
to
the
condenser
coolant
condensers
are
typically
heat
exchangers
which
have
various
designs
and
come
in
many
sizes
ranging
from
rather
small
hand-held
to
very
large
industrial-scale
units
used
in
plant
processes
for
example
a
refrigerator
uses
a
condenser
to
get
rid
of
heat
extracted
from
the
interior
of
the
unit
to
the
outside
air
condensers
are
used
in
air
conditioning
industrial
chemical
processes
such
as
distillation
steam
power
plants
and
other
heat-exchange
systems
use
of
cooling
water
or
surrounding
air
as
the
coolant
is
common
in
many
condensers
other
types
of
condensers
in
the
world
of
heating
ventilation
and
air
conditioning
hvac
condensers
happen
to
be
a
topic
of
great
importance
instead
of
confusing
information
the
goal
is
to
provide
some
basic
information
on
the
different
types
of
condensers
and
their
applications
there
are
three
other
condensers
used
in
hvac
systems
applications
most
common
uses
for
this
condenser
are
domestic
refrigerators
upright
freezers
and
in
residential
packaged
air
conditioning
units
a
great
feature
of
the
air
cooled
condenser
is
they
are
very
easy
to
clean
since
dirt
can
cause
serious
issues
with
the
condensers
performance
it
is
highly
recommended
that
these
be
kept
clear
of
dirt
they
also
require
a
cooling
tower
to
conserve
water
to
prevent
corrosion
and
the
forming
of
algae
water
cooled
condensers
require
a
constant
supply
of
makeup
water
along
with
water
treatment
depending
on
the
application
you
can
choose
from
tube
in
tube
shell
and
coil
or
shell
and
tube
condensers
all
are
essentially
made
to
produce
the
same
outcome
but
each
in
a
different
way
typically
these
are
used
in
large
commercial
air-conditioning
units
although
effective
they
are
not
necessarily
the
most
efficient
prior
to
beginning
your
install
make
sure
you
choose
a
condenser
that
will
provide
you
with
the
most
efficient
use
for
an
ideal
single-pass
condenser
whose
coolant
has
constant
density
constant
heat
capacity
linear
enthalpy
over
the
temperature
range
perfect
cross-sectional
heat
transfer
and
zero
longitudinal
heat
transfer
and
whose
tubing
has
constant
perimeter
constant
thickness
and
constant
heat
conductivity
and
whose
condensible
fluid
is
perfectly
mixed
and
at
constant
temperature
the
coolant
temperature
varies
along
its
tube
according
to
where
a
surface
condenser
is
an
example
of
such
a
heat-exchange
system
it
is
a
shell
and
tube
heat
exchanger
installed
at
the
outlet
of
every
steam
turbine
in
thermal
power
stations
commonly
the
cooling
water
flows
through
the
tube
side
and
the
steam
enters
the
shell
side
where
the
condensation
occurs
on
the
outside
of
the
heat
transfer
tubes
the
condensate
drips
down
and
collects
at
the
bottom
often
in
a
built-in
pan
called
a
hotwell
the
shell
side
often
operates
at
a
vacuum
or
partial
vacuum
produced
by
the
difference
in
specific
volume
between
the
steam
and
condensate
conversely
the
vapor
can
be
fed
through
the
tubes
with
the
coolant
water
or
air
flowing
around
the
outside
in
chemistry
a
condenser
is
the
apparatus
which
cools
hot
vapors
causing
them
to
condense
into
a
liquid
see
condenser
laboratory
for
laboratory-scale
condensers
as
opposed
to
industrial-scale
condensers
examples
include
the
liebig
condenser
graham
condenser
and
allihn
condenser
this
is
not
to
be
confused
with
a
condensation
reaction
which
links
two
fragments
into
a
single
molecule
by
an
addition
reaction
and
an
elimination
reaction
larger
condensers
are
also
used
in
industrial-scale
distillation
processes
to
cool
distilled
vapor
into
liquid
distillate
commonly
the
coolant
flows
through
the
tube
side
and
distilled
vapor
through
the
shell
side
with
distillate
collecting
at
or
flowing
out
the
bottom
a
condenser
unit
used
in
central
air
conditioning
systems
typically
has
a
heat
exchanger
section
to
cool
down
and
condense
incoming
refrigerant
vapor
into
liquid
a
compressor
to
raise
the
pressure
of
the
refrigerant
and
move
it
along
and
a
fan
for
blowing
outside
air
through
the
heat
exchanger
section
to
cool
the
refrigerant
inside
a
typical
configuration
of
such
a
condenser
unit
is
as
follows
the
heat
exchanger
section
wraps
around
the
sides
of
the
unit
with
the
compressor
inside
in
this
heat
exchanger
section
the
refrigerant
goes
through
multiple
tube
passes
which
are
surrounded
by
heat
transfer
fins
through
which
cooling
air
can
move
from
outside
to
inside
the
unit
there
is
a
motorized
fan
inside
the
condenser
unit
near
the
top
which
is
covered
by
some
grating
to
keep
any
objects
from
accidentally
falling
inside
on
the
fan
the
fan
is
used
to
blow
the
outside
cooling
air
in
through
the
heat
exchange
section
at
the
sides
and
out
the
top
through
the
grating
these
condenser
units
are
located
on
the
outside
of
the
building
they
are
trying
to
cool
with
tubing
between
the
unit
and
building
one
for
vapor
refrigerant
entering
and
another
for
liquid
refrigerant
leaving
the
unit
of
course
an
electric

supply
is
needed

if
the

is
located

the

can
provide
the
easiest

these
types
of
condensers
eject
heat
to
the
outdoors
and
are
simple
to
install
water

although
a
little
more
pricey
to

these
condensers
are
the
more
efficient
type
commonly
used
for

and
condensers
piped
for

these
condensers
require
regular
service
and
maintenance

while
these
remain
the
least
popular
