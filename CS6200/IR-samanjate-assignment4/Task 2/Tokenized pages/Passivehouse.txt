passive
passive
house
german
passivhaus
is
a
rigorous
voluntary
standard
for
energy
efficiency
in
a
building
reducing
its
ecological
footprint
it
results
in
ultra-low
energy
buildings
that
require
little
energy
for
space
heating
or
cooling
a
similar
standard
minergie-p
is
used
in
switzerland
the
standard
is
not
confined
to
residential
properties
several
office
buildings
schools
kindergartens
and
a
supermarket
have
also
been
constructed
to
the
standard
passive
design
is
not
an
attachment
or
supplement
to
architectural
design
but
a
design
process
that
is
integrated
with
architectural
design
although
it
is
mostly
applied
to
new
buildings
it
has
also
been
used
for
refurbishments
estimates
of
the
number
of
passivhaus
buildings
around
the
world
in
late
2008
ranged
from
15,000
to
20,000
structures
as
of
august
2010
there
were
approximately
25,000
such
certified
structures
of
all
types
in
europe
while
in
the
united
states
there
were
only
13
with
a
few
dozen
more
under
construction
the
vast
majority
of
passive
structures
have
been
built
in
german-speaking
countries
and
scandinavia
the
passivhaus
standard
originated
from
a
conversation
in
may
1988
between
bo
adamson
of
lund
university
sweden
and
wolfgang
feist
of
the
institut
fr
wohnen
und
umwelt
institute
for
housing
and
the
environment
germany
their
concept
was
developed
through
a
number
of
research
projects
aided
by
financial
assistance
from
the
german
state
of
hessen
the
eventual
building
of
four
row
houses
terraced
houses
or
town
homes
was
designed
for
four
private
clients
by
the
architectural
firm
of
bott
ridder
and
westermeyer
the
first
passivhaus
residences
were
built
in
darmstadt
germany
in
1990
and
occupied
by
the
clients
the
following
year
in
september
1996
the
passivhaus-institut
was
founded
also
in
darmstadt
to
promote
and
control
the
standards
since
then
thousands
of
passivhaus
structures
have
been
built
to
an
estimated
25,000
as
of
2010
most
are
located
in
germany
and
austria
with
others
in
various
countries
worldwide
after
the
concept
had
been
validated
at
darmstadt
with
space
heating
90
less
than
required
for
a
standard
new
building
of
the
time
the
economical
passive
houses
working
group
was
created
in
1996
this
group
developed
the
planning
package
and
initiated
the
production
of
the
innovative
components
that
had
been
used
notably
the
windows
and
the
high-efficiency
ventilation
systems
meanwhile
further
passive
houses
were
built
in
stuttgart
1993
naumburg
hesse
wiesbaden
and
cologne
1997
the
products
developed
for
the
passivhaus
standard
were
further
commercialised
during
and
following
the
european
union
sponsored
cepheus
project
which
proved
the
concept
in
five
european
countries
over
the
winter
of
20002001
in
north
america
the
first
passivhaus
was
built
in
urbana
illinois
in
2003
and
the
first
to
be
certified
was
built
in
2006
near
bemidji
minnesota
in
camp

company
that
has
since
built
more
passive

in
england
and

estimates
in
2008
of
the
number
of
passive

around
the

ranged
from
15,000
to
20,000
the
vast
majority
have
been
built
in
german-speaking
countries
or
scandinavia
the
first
certified
passive

in
the
antwerpen
region
of
belgium
was
built
in
2010
in
2011
the
city
of
heidelberg

germany
initiated
the
bahnstadt
project
which
was
seen
as
the
world
largest
passive

building
areas
a
company
in
qatar
is
planning
the
country
first
passivhaus
in
2013
the
first
in
the
region
while
some
techniques
and
technologies
were
specifically
developed
for
the
passive
house
standard
others
such
as
superinsulation
already
existed
and
the
concept
of
passive
solar
building
design
dates
back
to
antiquity
there
was
also
other
previous
experience
with
low-energy
building
standards
notably
the
german
niedrigenergiehaus
low-energy
house
standard
as
well
as
from
buildings
constructed
to
the
demanding
energy
codes
of
sweden
and
denmark
the
passivhaus
standard
requires
that
the
building
fulfills
the
following
requirements
these
standards
are
much
higher
than
houses
built
to
most
normal
building
codes
for
comparisons
see
the
international
comparisons
section
below
national
partners
within
the
for
the
promotion
of
european
passive
houses
are
thought
to
have
some
flexibility
to
adapt
these
limits
locally
by
achieving
the
passivhaus
standards
qualified
buildings
are
able
to
dispense
with
conventional
heating
systems
while
this
is
an
underlying
objective
of
the
passivhaus
standard
some
type
of
heating
will
still
be
required
and
most
passivhaus
buildings
do
include
a
system
to
provide
supplemental
space
heating
this
is
normally
distributed
through
the
low-volume
heat
recovery
ventilation
system
that
is
required
to
maintain
air
quality
rather
than
by
a
conventional
hydronic
or
high-volume
forced-air
heating
system
as
described
in
the
space
heating
section
below
in
passivhaus
buildings
the
cost
savings
from
dispensing
with
the
conventional
heating
system
can
be
used
to
fund
the
upgrade
of
the
building
envelope
and
the
heat
recovery
ventilation
system
with
careful
design
and
increasing
competition
in
the
supply
of
the
specifically
designed
passivhaus
building
products
in
germany
it
is
now
possible
to
construct
buildings
for
the
same
cost
as
those
built
to
normal
german
building
standards
as
was
done
with
the
passivhaus
apartments
at
vauban
freiburg
on
average
passive
houses
are
reported
to
be
more
expensive
upfront
than
conventional
buildings
5
to
8
in
germany
8
to
10
in
uk
and
5
to
10
in
usa
evaluations
have
indicated
that
while
it
is
technically
possible
the
costs
of
meeting
the
passivhaus
standard
increase
significantly
when
building
in
northern
europe
above
60
latitude
european
cities
at
approximately
60
include
helsinki
in
finland
and
bergen
in
norway
london
is
at
51
moscow
is
at
55
these
facts
have
led
a
number
of
architects
to
construct
buildings
that
use
the
ground
under
the
building
for
massive
heat
storage
to
shift
heat
production
from
the
winter
to
the
summer
some
buildings
can
also
shift
cooling
from
the
summer
to
the
winter
at
least
one
designer
uses
a
passive
thermosiphon
carrying
only
air
so
the
process
can
be
accomplished
without
expensive
unreliable
machinery
see
also
annualized
geo
solar
achieving
the
major
decrease
in
heating
energy
consumption
required
by
the
standard
involves
a
shift
in
approach
to
building
design
and
construction
design
may
be
assisted
by
use
of
the
planning
package
phpp
which
uses
specifically
designed
computer
simulations
to
achieve
the
standards
a
number
of
techniques
and
technologies
are
used
in
combination
passive
solar
building
design
and
energy-efficient
landscaping
support
the
passive
house
energy
conservation
and
can
integrate
them
into
a
neighborhood
and
environment
following
passive
solar
building
techniques
where
possible
buildings
are
compact
in
shape
to
reduce
their
surface
area
with
principal
windows
oriented
towards
the
equator
south
in
the
northern
hemisphere
and
north
in
the
southern
hemisphere
to
maximize
passive
solar
gain
however
the
use
of
solar
gain
especially
in
temperate
climate
regions
is
secondary
to
minimizing
the
overall
house
energy
requirements
in
climates
and
regions

to
reduce

vertical
gardens
green

and
other
techniques
are
implemented
passive
houses
can
be
constructed
from
dense
or
lightweight
materials
but
some
internal
thermal
mass
is
normally
incorporated
to
reduce
summer
peak
temperatures
maintain
stable
winter
temperatures
and
prevent
possible
overheating

on
the
predominant

the
use
of
deciduous
trees
and
wall
trellised
or
self
attaching
vines
can
assist
in
climates
not
at
the
temperature
extremes
passivhaus
buildings
employ
superinsulation
to
significantly
reduce
the
heat
transfer
through
the
walls
roof
and
floor
compared
to
conventional
buildings
a
wide
range
of
thermal
insulation
materials
can
be
used
to
provide
the
required
high
r-values
low
u-values
typically
in
the
0.10
to
0.15
wmk
range
special
attention
is
given
to
eliminating
thermal
bridges
a
disadvantage
resulting
from
the
thickness
of
wall
insulation
required
is
that
unless
the
external
dimensions
of
the
building
can
be
enlarged
to
compensate
the
internal
floor
area
of
the
building
may
be
less
compared
to
traditional
construction
in
sweden
to
achieve
passive
house
standards
the
insulation
thickness
would
be
335
mm
about
13
in
0.10
wmk
and
the
roof
500
mm
about
20
in
u-value
0.066

to
meet
the
requirements
of
the
passivhaus
standard
windows
are
manufactured
with
exceptionally
high
r-values
low
u-values
typically
0.85
to
0.70
wmk
for
the
entire
window
including
the

in
central
europe
and
most
of
the
united

for
unobstructed
south-facing
passivhaus
windows
the
heat
gains
from
the
sun
are
on
average
greater
than
the
heat
losses
even
in
mid-winter
building
envelopes
under
the
passivhaus

are
required
to

of

in
order
to
achieve
these
metrics
recommended
best
practice
is
to
test
the
building
air
barrier
enclosure
with
a
blower
door
at
mid-construction
if
possible
passive
house
is
designed
so
that
most
of
the
air
exchange
with
exterior
is
done
by
controlled
ventilation
through
a
heat-exchanger
in
order
to
minimize
heat
loss
or
gain
depending
on
climate
so
uncontrolled
air
leaks
are
best
avoided
another
reason
is
the
passive
house
standard
makes
extensive
use
of
insulation
which
usually
requires
a
careful
management
of
moisture
and
dew
points
this
is
achieved
through
air
barriers
careful
sealing
of
every
construction
joint
in
the
building
envelope
and
sealing
of
all
service
penetrations
use
of
passive
natural
ventilation
is
an
integral
component
of
passive
house
design
where
ambient
temperature
is
conducive
either
by
singular
or
cross
ventilation
by
a
simple
opening
or
enhanced
by
the
stack
effect
from
smaller
ingress
with
larger
egress
windows
andor
clerestory-operable
skylight
when
ambient
climate
is
not
conducive
mechanical
heat
recovery
ventilation
systems
with
a
heat
recovery
rate
of
over
80
and
high-efficiency
electronically
commutated
motors
ecm
are
employed
to
maintain
air
quality
and
to
recover
sufficient
heat
to
dispense
with
a
conventional
central
heating
system
since
passively
designed
buildings
are
essentially
air-tight
the
rate
of
air
change
can
be
optimized
and
carefully
controlled
at
about
0.4
air
changes
per
hour
all
ventilation
ducts
are
insulated
and
sealed
against
leakage
some
passivhaus
builders
promote
the
use
of
earth
warming
tubes
typically
200
mm
in
diameter
40
m
ft
long
at
a
depth
of
1.5
m
ft
these
are
buried
in
the
soil
to
act
as
earth-to-air
heat
exchangers
and
pre-heat
or
pre-cool
the
intake
air
for
the
ventilation
system
in
cold
weather
the
warmed
air
also
prevents
ice
formation
in
the
heat

system
heat

concerns
about
this
technique
have
arisen
in
some
climates
due
to
problems
with
condensation
and
mold
alternatively
an
earth

can
use
a
liquid

of
an

passivhaus

other
electrical
devices
but
not
dedicated
heatersas
well
as
body
heat
from
the
people
and
other
animals
inside
the
building
this
is
due
to
the
fact
that
people
on
average
emit
heat
equivalent
to
100
watts
each
of
radiated
thermal
energy
together
with
the
comprehensive
energy

measures
taken
this
means
that
a
conventional
central

system
is
not
necessary
although
they
are
sometimes
installed
due
to

instead
passive

a

climate
should
not
need
any

are
very
low
the

are
well

approaches
based

zebs
drive
the

down
to
0
kwhm
with
help
from
on-site

sources
and
can
benefit
from
materials

are
similar
to

it
could
be
helpful
for

to
use

instead
of

need
to
be
studied
to
adapt
the
passive

concept
for
use
in
more
regions
of
the
world
there
is
a
certified
passive
house
in
the
hot

of

which
uses
energy
recovery
ventilation
and
an
efficient
one
ton
air-conditioner
to
provide
cooling
and
dehumidification
solar
access
is
a
very
important
factor
in
any
design
of
a
passive

as
it
allows
the

to
use

solar
energy
to

this
implies
careful

of

to

this
can
be
counteracted
somewhat
by
opening
a
window
for
a
very
brief
time
by
plants
and
by
indoor
fountains
because
of

note
that
the
relatively

of

by

a

in
the
central

climate
quick
return

opening
windows
or
doors
for
a
short
time
has
only
a
limited
effect
after
apertures
are
closed
the
air
very
quickly
returns
to
the
normal
temperature
some
have
voiced
concerns
that
passivhaus
is
not
a
general
approach
as
the
occupant
has
to
behave
in
a
prescribed
way
for
example
not
opening
windows
too
often
however
modelling
shows
that
such
concerns
are
not
valid
in
the
united
states
a
house
built
to
the
passive
house
standard
results
in
a
building
that
requires

energy
of

an
