Since both of the program runs are independent of each other, we cannot
determine the exact importance of either of them over the other. Hence, we
would give equal importance to both of them.

For minimal loss of information, we can check for duplicate data in the two
lists and keep only one instance of the duplicate data. Since, the duplicate
data appeared in both files, this will be kept in the merged file as well.

The problem statement in the first question states that the URLs at a
shallower depth are considered to be more important than those at a deeper depth
than them, and they must be crawled first. Thus, the results of the two
independent lists will have important URLs crawled first and they will appear
earlier in the list.

We can then divide the remaining space (we have already added one instance of
the duplicate data) into two, and allocate them to the top URLs of the two lists
alternatively.
